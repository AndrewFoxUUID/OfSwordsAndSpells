Spellcasting:
 * There are 7 fundamental energy types: radiant, shadow, life, death, forge, true, and null.
 * Each spell takes some combination of those energy types, and is defined by the sort that it requires.
 * As the game progresses, spells are learned and inscribed into the spellbook, and a few of those spells can be queued into spell slots so that the player can prepare to cast them. Most spells need only energy, but some more potent spells may also require material components
